# Web Scraping Test in Python
A web scraping program written in Python that scrapes the Arkansas Medical Board website for a given search query. I have also written this in Java and is also on my Github as [Web-Scraping-Test](https://github.com/walco005/Web-Scraping-Test).

To run you need to download Beautiful Soup 4 and Selenium into the project. You also need to download PhantomJS and set it up to the PHANTOMJS_PATH in Test.py.
