# Web Scraping Test in Python
A web scraping program written in Python that scrapes the Arkansas Medical Board website for a given search query. I have also written this in Java and is also on my Github as [Web-Scraping-Test](https://github.com/walco005/Web-Scraping-Test).

To run you need to download the following and insert them into the project:

Beautiful Soup 4

Selenium

PhantomJS

PhantomJS must be put in the same path as listed in the Test.py file in the PHANTOMJS_PATH variable.
